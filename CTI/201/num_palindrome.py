"""
Let's call an integer a palindrome if it remains the same 
after reading its digits from right to left. 
Given a four-digit integer, print "YES" if it's a palindrome and print "NO" otherwise.
For example, the integer 1221 is a palindrome and we must print "YES", 
because it reads the same both from left to right and right to left.

Note: I will walk you over a complete UMPIRE process at the end of this section.
